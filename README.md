# op-e2e-devnet

This repository contains test data of OP devenet for end-to-end testing in https://github.com/babylonchain/finality-provider.

The data is generated by following the instructions in https://github.com/babylonchain/optimism/tree/develop/op-e2e

Specifically, we ran `make devnet-allocs` from our forked branch https://github.com/babylonchain/optimism/pull/15. It generated the devnet data and we copied it from `.devnet` and `packages/contracts-bedrock/deploy-config/` here.
